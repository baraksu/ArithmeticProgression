## Introduction:
- Name of the programmer: **Yoav Sagiv**
- Teacher: **Barak suberi**
- Grade: **10th**
- School:**Yeshiva Bnei Akiva Givat Shmuel**
- Year of submission: **2023**

## program actions
- Receives the initial number, the change and the size of the arithmetic series
- Prints the series
- Checks if the number entered by the user can be in the arithmetic series

## Users actions
- The user enters: the first number of the series, its delta and its size (amount of numbers).
- After, the program prints the arithmetic series to the user according to the data entered by the user
- And finally, the user can guess/check if a number entered can be in the arithmetic series

## Examples
![Example 1](https://github.com/YoavSagiv/YoavSagiv/assets/132649673/229fee3d-a90c-47b3-b156-9a6d1e3669f0)
- Here we have an image that prints the series properly 
and sends a positive answer to the question of the number in the series

![Example 2](https://github.com/YoavSagiv/YoavSagiv/assets/132649673/33ad6440-add9-49d5-b0db-4eba29f0451e)
- Here we have an image that prints the series properly 
and sends a negative answer to the question of the number in the series

![Example 3](https://github.com/YoavSagiv/YoavSagiv/assets/132649673/1f5f2474-9f60-4a65-990a-277719aa8a90)
- Here we have a picture that shows that if the current number in the series is
bigger than 4 digits ,the program does not do the second step.

## Development's stages
• I started the project by receiving the initial data (initial number, change and size).
I checked if the data I entered were really numbers. And I prepared the first and
the second and the third function that will shorten my lines of code.

• After receiving the data, I prepared the function that adds the change to the current number,
I created a sort of loop that prints the number, returns to add the change to the current number,
subtracts one from the size and stops when it reaches 0.

• Then, I received the fourth figure (a number that may be in a series) 
I checked if the data he entered were really numbers. And I prepared
the first and the second and the third function that will shorten my lines of code.

• Then, I created another function that does a simple comparison between the current number
and the number entered by the user. And I made a loop that activates the function

• If the number entered by the user:
- Smaller than the current number:
the system increases the current number by the third function and continues running
- Greater than the current number:
the system prints that the number is not in the array and stops the loop
- equal to the current number:
the system prints that the number is in the array and stops the loop

## Future
- Shorten as much as possible the lines of code and execution
- Makes another question that brings a certain series
and the user has to guess what the change is.
- Makes that there is a change for the change of the series 
For example: that at the beginning the number will increase by 1,
then by 2, then by 3 and so on...

## experience
• My project was challenging. I invested so much free time in this project
whether it was bringing the computer to school or whether it was sitting 
at home in front of the computer until late at night.

• I didn't always know at the beginning what to do and every time
there was a new problemthat I hadn't thought of and I had to solve it.

• But, despite all this. I was creative and think of solutions and 
there is no great feeling of satisfaction like when you manage to solve a problem.

Thanks everyone, I hope you enjoyed my project
